Welcome to the weather control room. It's real easy to make your rooms 
be affected by weather. Hehe, I changed the weather thingy again, oops! 
Don't cut off my thingy coz it's even easier now.  Do this instead:

include "/areas/Misc/Bad/c/include/defs.h"
inherit "/areas/Misc/Bad/c/inherit/outdoor_room";

  reset(arg) {
    ::reset(arg);
    if(arg) return;
    .......etc,etc
    set_room_desc("This is a room, this is where all the junk in the old "+
                  "set_long should be placed. etc. etc. \n");
    set_long(query_room_desc());
    .......etc,etc
  }

Note: you don't need all that query_original_long_desc(), WEATHER_PLEASE,
      NO_WEATHER_PLEASE, SNOW_PLEASE, do_snow_throw(), etc etc crap.
      The way the old control room worked was really ugly. Hopefully this
      new way is easier to understand and use.

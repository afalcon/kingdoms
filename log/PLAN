Plan:

 "I've found a way to make you, I've found a way, a way to make you smile.

  I read bad poetry into your machine.
  I save your messages just to hear your voice.
  You always listen carefully to awkward rhymes.
  You always say your name, like I wouldn't know it's you,
  At your most beautiful.

  I've found a way to make you, I've found a way, a way to make you smile.

  At my most beautiful. I count your eyelashes, secretly.
  With every one, whisper I love you. I let you sleep.
  I know you're closed eye watching me, listening.
  I thought I saw a smile. =o)

  I've found a way to make you, I've found a way, a way to make you smile."
